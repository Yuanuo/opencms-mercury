 * Helper class to export form data as CSV files that can be opened with Excel and

 * Excel (at least the German version from 2013 and 365) opens CSV files correctly if:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>separator is not the number separator (ie. ";" instead of ",")</li>
 *   <li>files are UTF-8 encoded WITH BOM</li>
 *   <li>all values are escaped by double quotes</li>
 *   <li>line breaks are only "\n".</li>
