      <content><![CDATA[<p><em>October 2, 2023</em>: OpenCms 16 brings the new app "Unused contents" that allows to find and delete content that is not actively used on any container page. It is now possible to select between several individual detail pages in the same website based on categories of the detail content. The gallery dialog in the editor has been improved with additional filter and grouping options, so that content managers can find relevant content faster. It can now be enforced that all content managers must set a new password after the next login. The default Mercury template brings several new features, for example the "Image tile display" formatter for the "Tabs / accordion" element.</p>

<p><span class="label label-red">Notice for users of Alkacon OCEE</span> Users of Alkacon OCEE require a new OCEE version for OpenCms 16. The update is free for Alkacon customers with a valid OCEE subscription. <a href="%(link7)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Please contact Alkacon</a> to receive the new version.</p>
<h3>Compatibility with Java versions, servlet containers and databases</h3>
<p>OpenCms 16 has been written and tested for Java 11 and Java 8. We have tested with ORACLEs JDK as well as OpenJDK. OpenCms should run with all compliant JVMs.</p>

<p>On the database side, we provide support for MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, DB2 and HSQLDB.</p>
